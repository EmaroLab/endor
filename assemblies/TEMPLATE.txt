THIS FILE DESCRIBES THE RULES FOR WRITING ASSEMBLY DESCRIPTIONS AS AND-OR GRAPHS
*this is NOT a valid assembly description file*

The assembly description file is composed of three sections:
1) header
2) nodes description
3) hyper-arc description

HEADER
The header should be the first line of the file, in the form of:
[graph name] [number of nodes] [name of the final assembly node]
For example:
    pencil_assembly 6 cap_&_filter_&_body

NODES DESCRIPTION
The nodes are described with [number of nodes] lines below the header,
each in the form of:
[node name] [node cost]
For example:
    cap_&_filter_&_body 2
    cap_&_filter 4
    body 1
    cap 1
    filter_&_body 2
    filter 1

HYPERARC DESCRIPTION
Each hyperarc is described by a set of at least 2 lines.
The first line should be in the form of:
[number of children nodes] [name of the father node]
For example:
    2 cap_&_filter_&_body
The following [number of children nodes] lines should be in the form of:
[child node name]
For example:
    cap_&_filter
    body
Hyperarcs are listed one after the other, for example:
    2 cap_&_filter_&_body
    cap
    filter_&_body
    2 cap_&_filter
    cap
    filter
    2 filter_&_body
    filter
    body
